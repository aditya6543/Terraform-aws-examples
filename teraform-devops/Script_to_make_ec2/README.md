# Terraform EC2 Instance Creation Script

This project is a basic Terraform automation script that launches an EC2 instance on AWS. It is meant for learning purposes and demonstrates how to use Terraform to provision cloud resources using AWS as the provider.

---

## üìÅ Files in This Repository

- **terraform.tf**  
  This file initializes the Terraform configuration and installs the required AWS provider.

- **providers.tf**  
  Defines the AWS provider details, including the region configuration.

- **ec2.tf**  
  Contains the Terraform script that provisions an EC2 instance on AWS. Each block is well-commented to explain its purpose.

---
- **remotebackup and state management**
#creates a backup file on aws dynamo db and s3 to create a remote .tf file to manage conflicts and remote stage code to this is in another folder named terraform-remote
  backend "s3" {                 
    bucket = "adiremote-test"
    key = "terraform.tfstate"
    region = "ap-south-1"
    dynamodb_table = "remote-infra"
    
  }


## ‚úÖ Prerequisites

Before you use this script, make sure you have the following set up:

1. **AWS CLI installed**  
   You can install it from [AWS CLI official docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html).

2. **Terraform installed**  
   Download it from the [Terraform website](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads).

3. **IAM User with EC2 Permissions**  
   - Create an IAM user in AWS.
   - Assign it permissions to manage EC2 instances.
   - Configure AWS CLI on your local system using `aws configure` with that IAM user‚Äôs access and secret keys.

4. **SSH Key Pair (Optional)**  
   - You‚Äôll need a public-private key pair if you plan to SSH into the EC2 instance.
   - Do **not** upload your `.pem` or `.pub` files to GitHub for security reasons.

5. **Added a install_nginx.sh**
   -this bash script installs nginx and creates a test html page to see if ngnix works properly

## üöÄ How to Use

1. Clone this repository:
   git clone "bla bla"
2. Initialize Terraform:

terraform init


3. Preview the plan:

terraform plan


4. Apply the configuration:

terraform apply

5. Test the Nginx page

copy paste your instance public ip to browse

6. To destroy the instance (when no longer needed):

terraform destroy

-------------
There are some commented out lines in the code with the explanation of what they do like metadata :-
1. count (for numer of instance to be made)
2. for_each and their outputs in outputs.tf (to make more than one instance but of different names and values)
